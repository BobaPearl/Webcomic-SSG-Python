    note: 'Something to consider when choreographing a fight scene in a comic is how many panels of action are there. There'' also pacing to consider. Are you properly pacing your fight? Are you giving everyone time to breathe, do people know where everything is happening, or is it even important at that moment? Fight scenes even with 3D models are a huge test of your skill as an artist. They require dynamism, anatomy, choreographing, planning, and placements. Maybe some people can just throw together a fight scene, but I find that if I don''t plan the whole thing out, it can quickly go to shit. If you''re an aspiring webcomic artist, think about your fight scene before you rush into it lol. <br /><br /> This second scene ended up feeling a lot "realer" to me than I had first intended,and another thing when making comics is that I''m worried I''m being discordant with the tone. We have Uncle punching his own shirt off one moment, and then Marie lamenting blowing up an apartment building in the next. We have people surviving multiple gun shot wounds, but I''m trying to still set this up as something important. Having a moment to talk about being dead named and lamenting it, while also accepting it as a heat of the moment thing between family is a very real experience that I feel like may be universal for transgender people like myself. Its'' like you accidentally turned your old name into a slur that can be used against you, and people can do it completely unwittingly because they simply didn''t know, or that''s what they''ve called you for decades.<br /><br />It''s a powerful personal moment, and time will tell if I made the right call or not using this personal thing for my comic.'

So if you notice things getting more dynamic after Uncle''s fight. That''s why. My life partner actually told me a trick to check for Dynamism that''s really easy, just go through and see if the head is a consistent size between panels. If the head always takes up the same amount of space on each panel, then you''re probably not being dynamic enough in your pages.<br /><br />I had a lot of fun with this one, playing with the lighting depending on the mood, the literal cloud and shadowed shroud that Claire is in. I also did a bit of reading on tea leaf reading which was fun.'

    Chapter: '1 - Prologue'
    page: '19'
    note: 'This character was a fun one to design (They''re all fun ones to design tbh,) Which required making a whole new skin map just to make sure I get everything consistent from scene to scene. We also get to see Trombozo act like a normal person, which is kind of important if we''re going to give him a relationship with one of the main characters lol.<br /><br /> Today''s update is so tiny because I updated on Monday and thought that I''d have another 20 panels done by today, and it''d be too big. Jokes on me of course, the opposite happened because of the ADHD medication shortage. What''s that? You haven''t heard of this? Well, for the last 6 months there have been dwindling supplies of Adderall, Ritalin, Vyvanse, hell even Modafnil have been rapidly dwindling. It hit the rural folks the worse, and has been slowing crawling it''s way through the country. Now it''s reached me, and without ADHD meds, I''m kind of a hot mess. Well more of a mess than normal. I learned a valuable lesson though, if I think I''m going to need to split an update, Then post one later, not one earlier. I think these panels would have been a nice little end cap to the last update. Ces la vie, such is life. See you next week On Thursday, in some Time Zone where it''s Thursday. (I try to get these out at midnight-ish Wednesday, but spread around different time zones to keep things interesting.)<br /><br />Also, I''m very open about this but someone asked me about my process, and since I don''t have twitter I don''t know if it''s still common knowledge. I make 3D models using custom skins, textures, and shaders (some purchased!) Then rig everything in Daz, draw over everything but the backgrounds, and then use AI to generate the backgrounds for me. Hey, if Eiichiro Oda and other comic people can rely on a team of artists to do the grunt work, why can''t I do the same with the immortal machine?! ;) <br /><br />A lot of the extraneous details of Spinnelope''s current outfit are to keep visual details straight. Watch how pieces of the leg laces, freckles, belly button piercing, and spider tattoo all line up with different landmarks of discoloration. I also gave her four freckles on one side, and three on the other, so I can tell when I''m messing up right and left. Beta Reader pointed out I should say why she looks like this. I have an irl foster brother who has vitiligo, and he''s lamented before that there''s no cool characters with it. He''s one of the few people who reads my comic that I know IRL, so it''s a little treat for him. Also assymetrical designs are pretty. Also I mean, look at her how could I not? Do you not see those cheekbones? The spider woumb tat? The lesbian manicure? She''s perfect!<br /><br />That''s really all I''ve got for this week''s episodes of Boots. Well except I went through my e-mail and found some more shit to throw in here <br /><br />To answer another fan''s question, all the horny shit is is now on Cohost. <a href="https://cohost.org/boba-pearl-nsfw">Which you can find at https://cohost.org/boba-pearl-nsfw</a>. There''s not much right now, but every once in a while I throw some shit up there.<br /><br /> Another fan asked where I got the idea for Boots from, and to be honest it all started with Marie and The Advenutrer''s League, which I wanted to be a crime drama that was a cross between Meg Mogg and Owl, and One Piece. I didn''t really nail that vibe, but I did learn a lot about comic making. A lot of the DNA of that is here, including many shared characters. If you mean the designs themselves well. I''m big gay and want to draw incredibly hot people doing badass shit. I had created this huge world, and was like "I''m going to make my epic!" and that failed miserably. I''m trying to get the archives for Marie up, but I did NOT name the files in any sensible way, so it''s slow going as I re-do each url by hand. That one died because it was my first comic ever, and I didn''t really know what I was doing, I kept the notes for a re-boot though, though if I did boots again, I would probably completely avoid naming everyone after Characters in Marie and The Adventurer''s League. To continue on, a big chunk of Boots comes from the end of my 2nd comic Steppe Into The Ring which we DO have archives for, when that one died it was very sad, but I learned a lot. It was right around when I was giving up on it I realized that the crime drama stuff is in my wheelhouse. This is my third comic, and mobsters are my FAVORITE shit. I think this story is a love letter to the God Father movies, Friday, and crime game plots, like GTA San Andreas, and my experiences as a transgender lesbian teen. lol this shit is way too long. This is what happens when you take my pills away.'

I really appreciated the comments I got recently, both publically and anonymously. Since I don''t post on Twitter, Tumblr, or any other social media, the comments are really the only engagement I get. It''s rather nice not having the pressure that the like and retweet brings, but sometimes it can get a bit lonely. I actually saw an extremely sweet comment in SAD a week or go that had just mentioned me in passing. I''m not 100% sure on goon''s reputation, but I do know I''ve found one of the best communities that has helped me flourish into an amazing artist. Maybe the brain degaussing is making me a bit sentimental. I''m not sure what I''m trying to say here, but I''m glad you''re here, and I''m ecstatic you''re all enjoying the comic.'

I''ve been largely focussing more on when I can fit in an animation, and the best place to break a page for tension.
