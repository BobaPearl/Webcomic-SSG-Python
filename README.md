How to get started

    
  Install Python= You need to have Python installed on your computer to run this script. You can download Python from https://www.python.org/downloads/
    Install Required Libraries= The script uses three libraries, os, yaml, glob, shutil, datetime, dateutil, and markdown. You can install these libraries using the following command in your terminal or command prompt= pip install os yaml glob shutil datetime python-dateutil markdown.
    Create a Project Folder= Create a new folder for your website project and open it in your terminal or command prompt.
    Copy the Script: Copy the provided script and save it as generate_html.py in your project folder.
    Copy the Front Matter File: Copy the front_matter.yaml file and save it in your project folder. This file contains the metadata for each page of your webcomic.
    Create Assets Folder: Create a new folder named assets in your project folder and copy the comic images into this folder.
    Create Image Folder: Create a new folder named img within the assets folder and copy the arrow images into this folder.
    Create CSS Folder: Create a new folder named css in your project folder and copy the CSS files into this folder.
    Run the Script: In your terminal or command prompt, navigate to your project folder and run the following command: python generate_html.py. This will generate HTML files based on the front matter data and an RSS feed.
    Upload the Files: Upload all the generated files, the images, and the CSS files to your website hosting service.


   This is a Python script for generating HTML pages and an RSS feed for a webcomic. The script first imports several modules necessary for the program to run: os, yaml, glob, shutil, datetime, dateutil, and markdown. The os module provides a way of using operating system dependent functionality, yaml is a library for parsing and emitting YAML, glob is a library for finding all files that match a pattern, shutil provides a higher level interface to file operations such as copying, datetime is a library for working with dates and times, dateutil is an extension to datetime to parse dates with more flexibility, and markdown is a library for converting Markdown to HTML.

   The first function read_front_matter(filename) takes a filename as an input and reads its contents, which are in YAML format, and returns the parsed data. The file is opened with the with statement, which automatically closes the file after it has been read.

   The generate_navigation(current_page, max_page_key) function generates the navigation section of the HTML pages. It takes two arguments: current_page and max_page_key. current_page is the page number of the current page being generated, and max_page_key is the maximum page number in the comic. The function first defines a local function page_url(page_key) which takes a page key as an argument and returns the URL of the page. The function then calculates the previous page key and the next page key using the current_page argument and the max_page_key argument. Finally, it returns a string of HTML code for the navigation section, which includes links to the first page, previous page, next page, and last page of the comic.

   The generate_html(front_matter, image_folder='assets') function takes two arguments: front_matter and image_folder. front_matter is a dictionary of metadata for each page of the comic, and image_folder is the folder that contains the images for the pages. The function first sets the last_generated_file variable to an empty string. Then it sorts the items in the front_matter dictionary and loops through each item, which is a page of the comic. For each page, the function creates an HTML file with the same name as the page key, removes the file if it already exists, and writes the content of the HTML file. The content includes the <head> section, which contains the meta information for the HTML page and the CSS stylesheets, the header section, which contains the logo and navigation links, the chapter, page, and title sections, the navigation section, which is generated by the generate_navigation() function, the images for the page, and the author's notes section, which is converted from Markdown to HTML using the markdown library. The function returns the name of the last generated file.

   The if __name__ == "__main__": statement at the bottom of the script is a special statement in Python that allows the script to be run as a standalone program. When the script is run, it reads the front matter from the front_matter.yaml file, generates the HTML pages, prints the name of the last generated file, creates a copy of the last generated file as index.html, and generates the RSS
