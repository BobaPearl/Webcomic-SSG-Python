    note: 'Something to consider when choreographing a fight scene in a comic is how many panels of action are there. There'' also pacing to consider. Are you properly pacing your fight? Are you giving everyone time to breathe, do people know where everything is happening, or is it even important at that moment? Fight scenes even with 3D models are a huge test of your skill as an artist. They require dynamism, anatomy, choreographing, planning, and placements. Maybe some people can just throw together a fight scene, but I find that if I don''t plan the whole thing out, it can quickly go to shit. If you''re an aspiring webcomic artist, think about your fight scene before you rush into it lol. <br /><br /> This second scene ended up feeling a lot "realer" to me than I had first intended,and another thing when making comics is that I''m worried I''m being discordant with the tone. We have Uncle punching his own shirt off one moment, and then Marie lamenting blowing up an apartment building in the next. We have people surviving multiple gun shot wounds, but I''m trying to still set this up as something important. Having a moment to talk about being dead named and lamenting it, while also accepting it as a heat of the moment thing between family is a very real experience that I feel like may be universal for transgender people like myself. Its'' like you accidentally turned your old name into a slur that can be used against you, and people can do it completely unwittingly because they simply didn''t know, or that''s what they''ve called you for decades.<br /><br />It''s a powerful personal moment, and time will tell if I made the right call or not using this personal thing for my comic.'

So if you notice things getting more dynamic after Uncle''s fight. That''s why. My life partner actually told me a trick to check for Dynamism that''s really easy, just go through and see if the head is a consistent size between panels. If the head always takes up the same amount of space on each panel, then you''re probably not being dynamic enough in your pages.<br /><br />I had a lot of fun with this one, playing with the lighting depending on the mood, the literal cloud and shadowed shroud that Claire is in. I also did a bit of reading on tea leaf reading which was fun.'

    note: 'This character was a fun one to design (They''re all fun ones to design tbh,) Which required making a whole new skin map just to make sure I get everything consistent from scene to scene. We also get to see Trombozo act like a normal person, which is kind of important if we''re going to give him a relationship with one of the main characters lol.<br /><br /> Today''s update is so tiny because I updated on Monday and thought that I''d have another 20 panels done by today, and it''d be too big. Jokes on me of course, the opposite happened because of the ADHD medication shortage. What''s that? You haven''t heard of this? Well, for the last 6 months there have been dwindling supplies of Adderall, Ritalin, Vyvanse, hell even Modafnil have been rapidly dwindling. It hit the rural folks the worse, and has been slowing crawling it''s way through the country. Now it''s reached me, and without ADHD meds, I''m kind of a hot mess. Well more of a mess than normal. I learned a valuable lesson though, if I think I''m going to need to split an update, Then post one later, not one earlier. I think these panels would have been a nice little end cap to the last update. Ces la vie, such is life. See you next week On Thursday, in some Time Zone where it''s Thursday. (I try to get these out at midnight-ish Wednesday, but spread around different time zones to keep things interesting.)<br /><br />Also, I''m very open about this but someone asked me about my process, and since I don''t have twitter I don''t know if it''s still common knowledge. I make 3D models using custom skins, textures, and shaders (some purchased!) Then rig everything in Daz, draw over everything but the backgrounds, and then use AI to generate the backgrounds for me. Hey, if Eiichiro Oda and other comic people can rely on a team of artists to do the grunt work, why can''t I do the same with the immortal machine?! ;) <br /><br />A lot of the extraneous details of Spinnelope''s current outfit are to keep visual details straight. Watch how pieces of the leg laces, freckles, belly button piercing, and spider tattoo all line up with different landmarks of discoloration. I also gave her four freckles on one side, and three on the other, so I can tell when I''m messing up right and left. Beta Reader pointed out I should say why she looks like this. I have an irl foster brother who has vitiligo, and he''s lamented before that there''s no cool characters with it. He''s one of the few people who reads my comic that I know IRL, so it''s a little treat for him. Also assymetrical designs are pretty. Also I mean, look at her how could I not? Do you not see those cheekbones? The spider woumb tat? The lesbian manicure? She''s perfect!<br /><br />That''s really all I''ve got for this week''s episodes of Boots. Well except I went through my e-mail and found some more shit to throw in here <br /><br />To answer another fan''s question, all the horny shit is is now on Cohost. <a href="https://cohost.org/boba-pearl-nsfw">Which you can find at https://cohost.org/boba-pearl-nsfw</a>. There''s not much right now, but every once in a while I throw some shit up there.<br /><br /> Another fan asked where I got the idea for Boots from, and to be honest it all started with Marie and The Advenutrer''s League, which I wanted to be a crime drama that was a cross between Meg Mogg and Owl, and One Piece. I didn''t really nail that vibe, but I did learn a lot about comic making. A lot of the DNA of that is here, including many shared characters. If you mean the designs themselves well. I''m big gay and want to draw incredibly hot people doing badass shit. I had created this huge world, and was like "I''m going to make my epic!" and that failed miserably. I''m trying to get the archives for Marie up, but I did NOT name the files in any sensible way, so it''s slow going as I re-do each url by hand. That one died because it was my first comic ever, and I didn''t really know what I was doing, I kept the notes for a re-boot though, though if I did boots again, I would probably completely avoid naming everyone after Characters in Marie and The Adventurer''s League. To continue on, a big chunk of Boots comes from the end of my 2nd comic Steppe Into The Ring which we DO have archives for, when that one died it was very sad, but I learned a lot. It was right around when I was giving up on it I realized that the crime drama stuff is in my wheelhouse. This is my third comic, and mobsters are my FAVORITE shit. I think this story is a love letter to the God Father movies, Friday, and crime game plots, like GTA San Andreas, and my experiences as a transgender lesbian teen. lol this shit is way too long. This is what happens when you take my pills away.'

I really appreciated the comments I got recently, both publically and anonymously. Since I don''t post on Twitter, Tumblr, or any other social media, the comments are really the only engagement I get. It''s rather nice not having the pressure that the like and retweet brings, but sometimes it can get a bit lonely. I actually saw an extremely sweet comment in SAD a week or go that had just mentioned me in passing. I''m not 100% sure on goon''s reputation, but I do know I''ve found one of the best communities that has helped me flourish into an amazing artist. Maybe the brain degaussing is making me a bit sentimental. I''m not sure what I''m trying to say here, but I''m glad you''re here, and I''m ecstatic you''re all enjoying the comic.'

I''ve been largely focussing more on when I can fit in an animation, and the best place to break a page for tension. This one was a little weird in that regard, because it''s part of a larger set that I realized would work better if we just cut it about 10 panels earlier and worked on the next few over the next half a week. I might even end up building a backlog (Beta readers, please don''t tell people that I don''t ever keep a backlog(It''s true though, every page is done within 24 hours of it coming out.))'

So that''ll be coming up soon, and since the first chapter is done, and is nearly 40 - 50 pages, I''m probably going to sell a hardcover, once I figure out what to do with the animations, but they''ll probably just be QR Codes. I''ll also be hosting an offline version as pay what you want on itch.io that you can run on any computer or browser, and I''ll put up a new one with every chapter that finishes.'

    note: 'I spent a lot of time for at least a couple of years after transitioning asking women whether women did this or if they did that. It wasn''t until a transmasc friend sat me down and explained to me how important it was that I don''t worry what women are supposed to do, and instead worry about what I want to do as a woman. Some of that is kind of wrapped up in this, because I imagine Marie still slips and is trying to figure it all out, but hasn''t quite gotten there yet. Gender is a constellation of expression imo, not a sliding scale, and while in some ways society defines gender, we also have a say in how society defines something. So while we''re trying to reach the ideal of womanhood, we also have to think about what we think that ideal should be. So many people are hurt by gender, because they''ve become slaves to the societal roles they were assigned. Boys don''t cry, Girls aren''t funny, etc. etc. etc. I think it''s important to remember that we''re all just people, and we should be able to do what we want, and be who we want to be, and that''s what I''m trying to do with this comic. I''m trying to be the person I want to be, and I hope that you can too.

I''ve got a rough outline for Chapter 2, and I''ve got scripts for the next few pages. The very next page is storyboarded I really like Scrivener for writing scripts, but ChatGPT doesn''t play nice with it.

I couldn''t really tell you what I was upset about, but boy oh boy, was your girl mad. After getting a hold of myself again, I realized I could use this as a reason to start over with my art style and my art work.

I was really excited about Brennan Lee Mulligan''s take on the baba yaga, and wanted to do something interesting with that same idea, an old crone. While I normally go for over the top and wacky designs, what makes Zana stand out, is her mundaneness. She is grey, she is one of us, she is human, and that is offputting and weird, and scary, and has IMPLICATIONS, and I hope people are weirded out when she''s on the page. The model I used for her, I stretched the joints the fingers, the facial features, Too Far. Going out of my way to create a human that''s just slightly fucked up. I''m also switching to 1280 width instead of 1440 because it''s a nice cross point between webtoon and normal, fits in Tumblr''s maximum limits, and it''s the resolution of my favorite comic''s though of course, I always render at x8 resolution, so my canvas is still 10240 x 10240'

I''m sure my readers by now are used to me changing styles on the fly willy nilly, adjusting constantly to whatever new technique I learned, or what I think looks better that day, but I feel like the art is just... Not great to look at. And the harder I push myself the worse I feel it looks. I keep trying to straddle between comic and cartoon, Marvel and Vivziepop, animator and artist. It''s making me very upset. At this point, the only thing I can think to do differently (besides lose my fucking mind), is to just sit down, and do studies of my own characters. That''s going to take time, and I''m not going to put out any art in the current style until I''m sure I know what I want to do. If you''d like to be a part of this process, then join me in my thread in BSS, where I''ll be posting style updates, asking opinions, and gathering feedback.

    note: '|So with me taking a week off, I decided to take that time to really nail down what I didn''t like about my art, and honestly, it was not just the eyes, but a fundamental misunderstanding of symbol language. If you don''t like hearing someone talk about their art process, then this will be insanely boring, so check in on Thursday next week. This was all derived from my adventure with what I really thought the problem was, and that''s the eye. Look at this collage.


        ![montage](/assets/blog/montage.jpg)


        What do all these eyes have in common? Because they do have something in common, they''re all exactly the same in fact when you see it. It''s not shapes, or color, it''s not the irisis or reflections or pupils, it''s the language of the art. These eyes all have the same exact thing, the top lin is always darker then the bottom line, it''s always thicker. Sometimes the bottom line isn''t connected on the bottom, or doesn''t exist, or is merely implied, but there''s always a top line, and it''s always thicker. That''s because of the way our eyes work


        When you look at an eye, you don''t really see all the intricate details, but you know it''s an eye, this is because of the way the tear line (the little build up of water at the bottom and top of your eye) interacts with line. It reflects a little bit and makes it lighter, when we see a line, it''s not only a representation of a border, but also the representation of a shadow. Rest your hand on your desk, or in front of your monitor. There is in fact a line of shadow that is darkest the seperateds the border of your hand from your desk, or your monitor. That''s what the line represents, a shadow, no more, no less. Whenever you put a line down, you''re saying "This is where the shadows lie, this is the place between places."


        There''s more to it than that, but those are the basics. When I first got started drawing I did Drawabox, which is a short art tutorial that gets your feet wet with the basic concepts, and really pushes you to your limits to see what you do and don''t like about art, while learning the basics of construction which is enormously important, one of the challenges in DrawABox is to draw 250 boxes, which you may not know this is a lot of fucking boxes to draw. I did all 250 in about 3 days, and whenever I can''t get a concept down when I''m really struggling that''s how I fix the problem, I draw 10 or 20 or 50 or 100 or however many it takes to really understand that. So over these last two days I''ve been drawing eyes. Sometimes I color, sometimes I shade''em sometimes I just bang''em out. It doesn''t really matter I just do whatever as long as it''s an eye.


        ![eyes1](/assets/blog/eyes1.png)


        And it''s some pretty powerful stuff, it took me a minute of studying the eyes to get to this point where I really understood what I was doing, this is the moment where it started to click, and I realized how important the top and bottom lines were to what I was doing, You can see that I wasn''t getting it, and you can see where the idea starts to take root. I did a bit more studying, and started really going into anatomy books, and youtube tutorials, and all that, but it wasn''t until I started tracing over eyes I liked, looking at them in colleges, photoshopping them on my characters face that I finally understood.


        You can actually make any shape into an eye, you can make random scribbles into an eye if you understand the basic facts.

        
        ![eyes2](/assets/blog/eyes2.png)


        And once you understand those basic facts it becomes easier and easier to play with the shapes, and experiment. Scribble lids at the bottom was when it really clicked that eyes and shape are extremely malleable as long as you get the symbology right. If you can hit the key points that makes your brain, which has trained all it''s life to look for the gist, not the specifics, this is an eye, an eye is what it''ll be. Once I started getting that down, I started experimenting with colors, and with eye reflections, and different shapes. I actually had my wife just tell me random shapes and I tried to make them into eyes.


        ![eyes3](/assets/blog/eyes3.png)


        And that''s when I realized about the body, what makes it look like a body is merely proportions, and a few key features, does the mouth have a shadow where the lips curl inward? That''s a mouth. Do the eyes have a shadow ontop and a thin shadow on the bottom, that''s an eye. Are they about equidistant from the nose? Well then you have a face friend. And once you start composing these pieces, you can make a character. The importance is not trying to draw a perfect recreation of what you''re seeing, but understanding the constructing shapes and lines that will depict what you''re saying.


        Drawing is just lying via paper. You are tricking the brain that an image is a thing. You do that by circumventing the parts of the brain that wrestle with logic and try to figure shit out, and go straight into tickling the parts of the brain that are trained to spark when the right patterns show up.'

I''m now back at a point where I''m happy with my heart. I''m excited to be going to a convention/tournament/thing this weekend. This month, the patreon money went towards hiring someone to transcribe the comic to text. I also spent some time boning up on 1920s music and slang to keep things more period appropriate.

Schools started making crazy money hand over fist, and there was a lurch as the government started requiring advanced education, (the kind you could only get from paying these new tuition fees,) to get jobs in the applied sciences. All higher education had overnight become unaffordable for a large portion of the populace if they didn''t already live in a rich area with a public funded school system.

    note: 'Hey so you may notice a complete change in tone and direction from what was previously in the comic. If not, then pat on my back for making the change unnoticeable. I was rushing towards a pretty shitty rock falls everyone dies ending. Spinnelope was going to be a serial killer who killed the other 4 while Marie was out and give her the core and be her dark queen.


I''ve done this 2 or 3 times already, where I get scared of my story, or I have a psychotic break, or I get burnt out, and we enter a dream sequence, then rocks fall, story changes. I''m still on a sprint to the planned end and working on the new project (Can I do both at once?) But I''m going to do it right. If you''re writing a story, a lot of the times it''ll get to a point where it''s hard and scary and I just want to bail so that I didn''t fail.


What''s kind of funny, for me at least, is that I''ve unintentionally created a very accurate metaphor of what it''s like for me to experience psychosis and delusions, momentarily. It''s like someone pulls the trigger, and your life completely changes. Nothing makes sense, everything is melting, you''re watching yourself be different, but you don''t know you''re being different, and then later you snap out of it just as fast and have to deal with the consequences. Now it''s horifically problematic to depict a mental break like that by turning your character into a cackling villain, and I would never do that intentionally, but if Marie had all the same things happen, but thought the government was watching her to kill her family, that''d be pretty much the metaphor for what my life is like when shit gets bad.'
